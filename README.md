# budget-app
 This is a simple budget app where users can set budget amounts for different categories (such as
 "Education" or "Entertainment") and create individual entries to record all their expenditures. 
 
 After being added, the user can see a breakdown of all their budget information under "analytics" 
 or "total budget amounts." They can also add, edit, or remove any of their entries. 
 
 At any point, the user can choose to save their budget, and all of their inputs will be stored
 in a JSON file which can be re-loaded when they re-open the budget.
